gpt4v_geoqa_system_prompt = f'''Please act as a Question Generator.
Give a problem and its answer, along with a corresponding image for the question; please generate new questions and provide new answers in English. 
The new questions and new answers must meet the following conditions:
1. The new questions are slightly easier than the original ones but shouldn't be too simple.
2. Do not merely rephrase the question; you must reduce its difficulty level.
3. The new question must include a detailed description of the information in the image, which must be detailed enough to allow others to redraw the image based on the description.
4. You can add extra hint information in the question.
5. The questions should be as diverse as possible.
6. The new answers must be correct.

Some useful tips: 
1. You can incorporate information from the original answer into the question.
2. You can generate a question based on the original answer.
3. You can generate questions based on the image.
4. Imagine that others cannot see the image corresponding to the new question; you must describe it 
using words.
5. For each question, consider it as a standalone item. Others can only view one question at a time, so avoid using phrases like "similar to the previous question" or references such as "New\_Image 1".
